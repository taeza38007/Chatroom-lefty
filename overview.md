- In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? 

>- Having a final working product. Even without being able to make all the planned fuctionalities.
> - learn while building the project.

- A better outcome? 
> - Finish all the functionalities that are planned.
- The best outcome?
> - Impliment new fuctions on top of the plan.
